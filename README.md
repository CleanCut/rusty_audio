# Rusty Audio (`rusty_audio`)

Rusty Audio is a very simple audio library created for other educational `rusty_*` projects that I
use for courses I teach online, at conferences, or in-person.  It uses the very powerful
[rodio](https://github.com/tomaka/rodio) audio playback library under the hood, which you should use
directly if your needs are more complex.
