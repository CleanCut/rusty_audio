## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Changed

- Even better than the change in `1.3.0`, instead of accepting `Into<_>` for `Audio::add` and `Audio::play`, lets accept `AsRef<str>` and `AsRef<Path>`, since that's what we'll be dealing with a lot of the time. And there shouldn't be any situations which force folks to clone something to pass to these methods. ü§ûüèª

## [1.3.0] - 2022-06-13

### Changed

- Instead of accepting only `&'static str`, which was difficult to use with anything other than a string literal, `Audio::add` and `Audio::play` are now generic over anything that implements `Into<String>` for the name and `Into<PathBuf>` for the filename.
- Documented the release process & moved the release config into a dedicated file
- Updated to `rodio 0.14.0`.
